# TwentyTwenty Darkmode Child-Theme

I created this theme as an example for an article on my personal blog. This blog posts describes how to change the the block-editor styles based on the selected page-template.

# Installation
1. Clone this repo
2. install all dependencies with `npm install` and `composer install`
3. Setup your local env by running `npm run bootstrap` and enter the url under which you can access your WordPress.
4. Run `npm start`for development or `npm run build` for creating the production build

This Theme uses wpack.io for the build process. Detailed information can be found in their docs: https://wpack.io/apis/
